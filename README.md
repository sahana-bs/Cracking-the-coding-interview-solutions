# Cracking-the-coding-interview-solutions
Solutions in python to the problems in the book "Cracking the coding interview"

Here comes the interview prep time (again).
This time I wanted to document the solutions I code. So, this repository contains the python solutions to the book, "Cracking the coding interview" by  Gayle Laakmann Mcdowell. I really like the flow of the book and the questions are pretty good.

As and when I read the book, I (try to) code the solutions and update it here. I usually analyze the time and space complexities at the beginning of each program. Sometimes, when I cannot think of a good solution, I look into the implementations of the wonderful coders out there and gracefully credit them :)

Abbreviations:
PC: Pseudo code
TC: Time complexity
SC: Space complexity
AS: Auxiliary Space

Python version: 3.9.6

## Missing Semester
So aptly named, this literally is the [missing semester](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/) of our CS education. Notes of some lectures and the exercises are in the folder "missing semester".
