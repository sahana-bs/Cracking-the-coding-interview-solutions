-Does not provide constant time access unlike arrays.
-Will traverse across k elements to find the kth element.
-Should consider if the removed node Should be reallocated?
-In an interview be sure to clarify if they mean a sll or a dll


-Remember while using ll(single/double), pointers are recursion are the two most important concepts by which we can solve nay problem
Then why use ll?
-It gives the benefit of adding the elements at the beginning and the end of the list at constant time***
-After finishing recursion, visit ll, they are closely related.
