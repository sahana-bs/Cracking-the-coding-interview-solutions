->In Python variables are just labels to objects in memory. In Python numeric objects are immutable.
 Hence by a++ (if a=10) we are trying to increment value of 10 object to 11 which is not allowed.
->Lots of commonly used primitive types are immutable. List, set and dict is mutable.
->Python doesnâ€™t even have variables. Python has names, not variables. It is a dynamic programming language.
->Python is not a verbose language unlike Java(super verbose).This is false. Verbose means lots of symbols.
Terse means fewer symbols.
